# SLitrani_R6
A modified form of SLitrani, originally from: https://crystalclear.web.cern.ch/crystalclear/SLitraniX/SLitrani/index.html

As of right now, in order to compile SLitrani you'll have to modify the ROOTDEV varible in each of the subfolders to point to where you want to install SLitrani. 

By default I have debugging enabled, and will eventually modify things to make it an option.
